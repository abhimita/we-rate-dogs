# Data Wrangling Project - WeRateDogs

This project is part of Udacity's data analyst course. Data wrangling is the focus of the project. Most of the time real world data is not clean. Data comes in different shape and form. Data gathering requires expertise in programatic data downloading, web scraping, use of API calls and multitude of other techniques. Gathered data is asssessed for cleanliness, tidiness and strcutural anomalies. Those are corrected before the final dataset is ready for analysis.

In this project, dataset comes from Twitter archive for Twitter handle @dog_rates (WeRateDogs). They rate people's dogs with humorous comment and numerical rating. There is additional supporting dataset indicating dog's breed, retweets and likes given to a tweet.
